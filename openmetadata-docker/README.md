This docker-compose file contains only components related to OpenMetadata without an ingestion framework. This configuration is intended to be a lightweight alternative - users can choose how to orchestrate their metadata ingestion workflows, whether this is a specific workflow orchestration platform, self-hosted scheduler, or simple CLI jobs scheduled with CRON. This way, OpenMetadata can be deployed separately from the ingestion engine, allowing greater flexibility and easier maintenance.

Follow the metadata ingestion documentation for guidance on choosing and configuring a workflow orchestration engine suitable for your use case.
